This is a companion "project" for this blog posts: https://stuff.tamius.net/sacred-texts/2024/09/18/how-to-print-your-guild-wars-2-character-or-any-game-really/

TL;DR: Do you like extracting 3D models from video games as they appear on screen (specifically NOT in default/T-pose)? If you extract your models with Intel GPA, you'll
find that models in output geometry have a bit of a squish to them.

There's two solutions for that issue. 

1. Pay money for NinjaRipper
2. Save some money and use this project to fix the squish for you (asterisks apply).
